## Project Overview
PathFinderPro is a Spring Boot + JavaScript based route optimization system that calculates the shortest distance between cities using advanced graph algorithms like Dijkstra’s Algorithm, Bellman-Ford Algorithm, and A* Search Algorithm.

It helps users find the most efficient routes for navigation, logistics, and transportation planning.

## Features

Dijkstra’s Algorithm – Finds the shortest path between two cities.
Bellman-Ford Algorithm – Works with graphs containing negative weights.
A* Search Algorithm – Optimized shortest path using heuristics.
Graph Visualization – Interactive frontend (HTML, CSS, JS).
User Input Support – Enter cities, distances, and view optimal paths.
REST APIs (Spring Boot) – Backend services for path calculations.

## Technologies Used

Java (Spring Boot) – Backend framework for APIs and services.

HTML / CSS / JavaScript – Frontend interface for visualization.

Graph Data Structures – Efficient representation of cities & routes.

Maven / Gradle – Build and dependency management.
